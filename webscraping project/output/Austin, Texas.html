    <h1>Austin, Texas</h1>
    <h2>A Background</h2>
    <p>
    Austin is located in central Texas and is also the state capital of Texas. The land is a flat prairie near the Colorado River. It has the fastest growing population of any city in the United States with over 300,000 inhabitants. The location itself is defined by its live music and tech industry. Of course, like most cities, it started from humble beginnings when in 1837, United States Vice President Mirabeau B. Lamar, happened to be on a buffalo-hunting expedition when he stated that the land where Austin is now would become the Texas state capital. Later, in 1839, the land was deemed the state capital and named Austin, after the founder of Texas, Stephen F. Austin.
